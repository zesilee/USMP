# Skill Sanitization Checklist

When extracting a skill from a business project for public distribution, systematically remove all business-specific content to make it generic and reusable.

## Quick Scan Commands

Run these grep patterns to identify potential sensitive content:

```bash
# Business/product names (case-insensitive)
grep -rniE "mercury|portal|underwriting|glean|[company-name]|[product-name]" skill-folder/

# Person names (look for capitalized names)
grep -rniE "\b(Oliver|John|Alice|Bob|建斌|小明)\b" skill-folder/

# Absolute paths and usernames
grep -rniE "/Users/|/home/|/mnt/c/Users|OneDrive|username" skill-folder/

# Chinese characters (if skill should be English-only)
grep -rn '[一-龥]' skill-folder/

# Internal jargon
grep -rniE "ultrathink|internal-only|confidential" skill-folder/
```

## Categories to Sanitize

### 1. Product and Project Names

**What to find:**
- Project codenames (e.g., "Mercury Prepared", "Project Phoenix")
- Internal product names (e.g., "Reviewer Portal", "Admin Dashboard")
- Tool-specific names (e.g., "Glean Gemini" → just "Gemini")

**How to replace:**
- Use generic terms: "the system", "the application", "the service"
- Use placeholder patterns: `<project-name>`, `<product-name>`
- Use generic examples: "e-commerce platform", "user management system"

### 2. Person Names

**What to find:**
- Real employee names in examples: "Oliver will handle...", "建斌你来..."
- Team member references in action items
- Author attributions that reveal identity

**How to replace:**
- Use generic names: "Alice", "Bob", "the developer", "the reviewer"
- Use role-based references: "Backend team", "PM", "Designer"
- Remove author attributions or use placeholders

### 3. Entity and Data Model Names

**What to find:**
- Business-specific entities: `REVIEW_RESULT`, `RISK_MODEL`, `INSPECTION_FACTOR`
- Domain-specific hierarchies: `Section → Area → Item → Evidence`
- Field names revealing business logic: `risk_level`, `underwriting_status`

**How to replace:**
- Use generic entities: `ORDER`, `ORDER_ITEM`, `USER`, `PRODUCT`
- Use generic hierarchies: `Category → Subcategory → Item → Detail`
- Use generic fields: `status`, `quantity`, `customer_name`

### 4. Folder Structures and Paths

**What to find:**
- Team-specific folders: `10-team-collaboration/Meeting Minutes`
- Project-specific paths: `reviewer-portal-api-design`
- Environment-specific paths: user home directory project paths

**How to replace:**
- Use generic paths: `project-docs/meeting-minutes`
- Use placeholder paths: `<project-root>/docs/`
- Use relative paths within skill bundle

### 5. Internal Terminology and Jargon

**What to find:**
- Internal slang: "ultrathink", "deep dive session"
- Company-specific processes: "Mercury standup", "Portal review"
- Abbreviations without context: "MP", "RP", "UW"

**How to replace:**
- Use industry-standard terms: "deep review", "thorough analysis"
- Expand or remove unexplained abbreviations
- Use generic process names

### 6. Language-Specific Content

**What to find:**
- Chinese phrases in English skills: "后面再说", "MVP 先不做"
- Mixed language examples that assume bilingual context
- Culture-specific references

**How to replace:**
- Translate to the skill's primary language
- Use language-neutral examples
- Or explicitly support multilingual with clear labels

### 7. Business Logic Examples

**What to find:**
- Domain-specific workflows: "Underwriting system conflicts"
- Business rules: "Inspection Factor vs Risk Factor"
- Industry-specific terminology without explanation

**How to replace:**
- Use generic software examples: "Note field conflicts with Comment system"
- Use universal patterns: "UserProfile vs Account naming conflict"
- Add context if domain terms are necessary

### 8. External Service References

**What to find:**
- Internal APIs: `POST /evaluate (push to Risk Model)`
- Company-specific integrations: "Sync with Underwriting system"
- Internal tool names: "Glean search", "Internal Wiki"

**How to replace:**
- Use generic services: `POST /process (send to External Service)`
- Use placeholder APIs: `<external-api>/endpoint`
- Use generic tool categories: "enterprise search", "knowledge base"

## Sanitization Process

### Phase 1: Automated Scan

```bash
# Run all grep patterns above
# Export results to a file for review
grep -rniE "pattern1|pattern2|pattern3" skill-folder/ > sanitization_report.txt
```

### Phase 2: Manual Review

For each match:
1. Determine if it's truly business-specific or generic
2. Decide on appropriate replacement
3. Check if replacement maintains meaning
4. Verify no broken references

### Phase 3: Verification

After sanitization:
1. Re-run all grep patterns - should return no matches
2. Read through skill to ensure coherence
3. Test skill functionality still works
4. Have someone unfamiliar with the original project review

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Over-sanitizing generic terms | "reviewer" as a role is fine; "Reviewer Portal" is not |
| Breaking examples by removing context | Replace with equivalent generic examples |
| Leaving orphaned references | Check all cross-references after renaming |
| Inconsistent replacements | Use find-and-replace for consistency |
| Sanitizing technical terms | Keep industry-standard terms (API, JSON, MVP) |
